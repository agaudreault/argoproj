The following steps should be completed by the Lead or a current Approver a few days prior to the membership meeting

- [ ] Post a reminder in the #argo-cd-contributors CNCF Slack channel that the membership promotion cycle is coming up
  ```
  Hey, all :wave: Argoproj membership and promotions requests are being reviewed `<DATE>`. If youâ€™re interesting in being an Argoproj member, or if you are already a member and would like to be considered for promotion, please read the membership document and submit an issue on the argoproj/argoproj repo! https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/master/community/membership.md
  If you already have an open issue, please make sure the description is up to date with all your latest and greatest contributions. :slightly_smiling_face:
  ```
- [ ] Create a new speadsheet as a copy of the last one, and give access to people with the link
- [ ] Update the spreadsheet to match the membership/promotion requests in the argoproj/argoproj repo.
- [ ] Add a valid Zoom link to the spreadsheet
- [ ] Once the spreadsheet is ready, post it in #argo-approvers


After the Membership meeting is concluded, you should

- [ ] Follow the different checklists for role promotions
  - [Member](./member-promotion-checklist.md)
  - [Reviewer](./reviewer-promotion-checklist.md)
  - [Approver](./approver-promotion-checklist.md)
  - [Lead](./lead-promotion-checklist.md)
- [ ] Create and merge a new pull request in argoproj/argoproj to reflect the changes (e.g. https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/pull/342)
  - [ ] Update the [MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/argoproj/argoproj/blob/master/MAINTAINERS.md) file.
- [ ] Send a message to the #argo-cd-contributors tagging new members to update their membership to Public
  ```
